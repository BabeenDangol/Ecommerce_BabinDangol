# Lab 2 Adding Brand, Category and Product


  ## a. Introduction:
  
  In our first lab, we made a produvt module. Presently, we include a brand, product and category within the product module which encompasses a structure of the er graph as appeared underneath:
 
  
   ## b.Objective: 
 
        1.To Add Product, Brand, Category and Color
        2.To perform CRUD operations on all three models.  
        3.To verify the frontend and backend in the browser. 
        4.To get more information about the admin.py, models.py as well as other files that django framework provides
        5.To get more information about adding models and how models.py works

  ## c. Procedure:

**1. Initializing environment**

  We downloaded the software and environments required for the project. Those were:
  * Python
  * Pip
  * Sqlite
  * DBeaver
  * Django
  * VS Code
  * Github account

**2. we initialize django project and migrated files**

    syntax:
      python - m django startproject ecommerce_babin
      cd ecommerce_babin
      
      
 **3. initialize the database** 
 
     To run the project: 
     syntax:              
        python manage.py runserver
              To add a module: python manage.py startapp product_module
              
  **4. Source Control**
Finally, for source control, we used Git. We built a repository called ecommerce babin and a markdown file called "lab1.md" that contains this document. The code and folder were then committed and published to the repository. The repository is now available at:https://github.com/BabeenDangol/Ecommerce_BabinDangol/

  ## e. Conclusion:
  
  As a result, in the first lab, we built our own project using the Django framework. There is now a superuser. I started the server, verified that the database was up and running, and then tested both the frontend and backend. On the server, I performed a CRUD activity and installed the branding module.
